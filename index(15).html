      <h1>About product</h1>
     <h6>
      <li>EFFECTIVE HYDRATION – E45’s Daily Cream offers effective, everyday hydration. As skin gets drier, it feels and looks less healthy and becomes less effective at retaining moisture, which leaves it even more dry. Our cream soothes, protects, and restores very dry skin – it intensely replenishes moisture to sooth dryness and smooth out rough skin. The cream locks in moisture to help better protect the skin against moisture loss, and to help restore and maintain the skin’s moisture level.</li>
      <li>MOISTURISING INGREDIENTS – Our Daily Cream contains light liquid paraffin that has emollient moisturising properties to help keep the skin hydrated. The perfume-free gentle formula is non-greasy and quickly absorbed and is even suitable for sensitive skin. The cream is easy to apply to skin and can be used whenever the skin feels dry, locking in moisture and leaving you with long-lasting softness in just 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>DERMATOLOGICALLY TESTED – E45’s formulation is dermatologically tested and does not contain any unnecessary colour or fragrances. It is suitable for everyday use on dry and sensitive skin for the whole family, including infants over the age of 1 month. You can apply the cream all over the body, including the face, for soft and supple skin. The cream has a low viscosity with watery consistency which can be thoroughly applied on the skin and is easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>QUALITY SKINCARE EVERY DAY – For 60 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions. We understand the importance of quality everyday products that care for your skin with minimal fuss. The E45 range of products has been developed for different skin types and parts of the body and works hard to protect and maintain skin health. It has proven dermatological expertise dedicated to vulnerable dry skin.</li>
      <li>HISTORY OF E45 – We released our E45 Cream in 1952 after a customer request for a product that would soothe and protect the skin. In 1963 physicians noticed the benefits of E45 cream for dry skin conditions and our cream was introduced to pharmacy and retail in 1980. We’ve continued to create products with patients and their skin in mind. We strive to continue to serve the needs of patients and healthcare professionals and produce better treatment options for patients' skincare routines.</li>
